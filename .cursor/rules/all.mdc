## MCP
> This configuration is for when you have access to MCP servers. 
You can use sequential-thinking and memory to break up complex tasks into parts. Consider sequential-thinking to be RAM, and memory to be disk storage.  
Check memory at the beginning of tasks to see what our overarching plans may be.

## VERSION MANAGEMENT
for node, we use `nvm`. There should be an `.nvmrc` file within the project root directory. 
for python, we use `pyenv` along with `pyenv virtualenv` -- the pyenv for this project is called 'ndaexpress311'
