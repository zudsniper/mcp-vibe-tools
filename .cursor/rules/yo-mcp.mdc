If you need my input to answer a question or when you finish a task and want to know what to do next you must send me a yo using the yo-mcp MCP tool.

In the yo you MUST provide ONLY a very short message (think like an email subject line) for why you need my attention / input.

Then reply with your update / question to the normal chat.
